## Key Findings Descriptive Analysis)
Global Revenue: The total aggregated sales reached approximately 68.302 Billion USD.

Market Dominance: The United Kingdom (UK) is the overwhelmingly dominant market, contributing ~56.6% of the total revenue and volume.

Top Tier Markets: Secondary high-performing markets include Australia, Japan, France, and Germany.

Quantity vs. Value: The analysis indicates potential differences in Average Selling Price (ASP) or purchase volume per transaction across different countries, suggesting varied purchasing power between markets.

## Insights
High Market Risk: The high dependency on the UK market represents a significant business risk. Diversification is necessary to safeguard against single-market fluctuations.

Growth Opportunity: Secondary markets (Australia, Japan) exhibit strong buying power and should be prioritized for targeted growth strategies and potential premium product launches.

Immediate Action Required: A deeper analysis is crucial to understand what products are driving the revenue in the UK versus international markets to optimize the supply chain.

## Recomendation
Mitigate Single Market Dependency Risk: The company must allocate marketing and logistical resources to accelerate growth in secondary markets (Australia, Japan, France, and Germany). The objective should be to reduce the UK's contribution to below 50% within the next 12 months for revenue diversification.

Conduct an in-depth Average Selling Price (ASP) analysis comparing products sold in the UK versus secondary markets. If the ASP is higher in secondary markets, these countries should be designated as primary targets for launching premium or high-margin products.

Optimize Inventory by Geography: Identify the Top 10 Bestsellers in the UK separately from the Top 10 Bestsellers in international markets. This information must be used to optimize the supply chain and reduce regional holding costs by ensuring stock matches local demand.
